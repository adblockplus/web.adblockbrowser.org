{{default-filter-list Adblock Browser requires filter lists to block ads. A default filter list based on your browser's language settings is automatically enabled when Adblock Browser is installed.}}

{{additional-filter-lists There are two basic filter lists â€“ EasyList and Fanboy's List. These two filter lists block ads from the most popular (often English language-based) websites. However, these filter lists do not block ads on less popular national websites. For example, if you live in Germany you should subscribe to the national German filter list.}}

<p>{{note-text As a recommendation, you should avoid adding too many filter lists to Adblock Browser. Adding too many filter lists slows down the ad blocker and, therefore, your browsing.}}</p>
