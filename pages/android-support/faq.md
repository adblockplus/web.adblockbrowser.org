*  <strong>{{many-permissions-question[Many permissions questions] Why does Adblock Browser for Android require so many permissions?}}</strong>
    * {{many-permissions-answer[Many permissions answer] Generally, browsers require more permissions than regular apps to be able to provide web applications the ability to use hardware functionality such as camera, microphone, etc. (e.g. uploading images from your camera). Since Adblock Browser is based on Firefox, it asks for the exact same permissions to do the same things Firefox does. For an explanation of all the permissions, please refer to [this FAQ](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-firefox-android-use-permissions-it-requests) from Mozilla.}}
*  <strong>{{flash-question[Flash video support question] Will Adblock Browser support flash videos?}}</strong>
    * {{flash-answer[Flash video support answer] Flash videos do work on Adblock Browser, but you must install the legacy flash player first. However, installing Flash for Android is not recommended as it’s insecure and may contribute to memory loss and slowness. If you still want to do this, refer to [this article](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-watch-flash-videos-firefox-android) from Mozilla.}}
*  <strong>{{firefox-sync-question[Firefox synchronization question] Will you offer Firefox sync?}}</strong>
    * {{firefox-sync-answer[Firefox synchronization answer] Many of you have asked for this, and we agree this is a critical feature. That’s why we are working on enabling this in a future release.}}
*  <strong>{{chrome-bookmark-question[Chrome bookmark import question] How do I import bookmarks from Chrome?}}</strong>
    * {{chrome-bookmark-answer[Chrome bookmark import answer] If the default system browser is Chrome, you should be able to import bookmarks from Settings > Customize > Import from Android. If, however, the default browser is NOT Chrome, there's unfortunately nothing we can do.}}
*  <strong>{{google-sync-question[Google account synchronization question] Will you support Chrome / Google Account (passwords, bookmarks, etc.) syncing when Chrome is not the default browser?}}</strong>
    * {{google-sync-answer[Google account synchronization answer] Unfortunately, this is currently not a feature in Firefox for Android and as such, would be considered new browser functionality, which for now, we'll leave to the folks at Mozilla.}}
*  <strong>{{add-ons-question[Add-ons installation question] Can I install add-ons like LastPass and Ghostery, or other third-party services?}}</strong>
    * {{add-ons-answer[Add-ons installation answer] Having started as a browser add-on ourselves, we feel strongly about wanting to support add-ons, and hope to support this in the future. For now, if having add-ons is a deal breaker, we recommend using Firefox for Android with [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/).}}
*  <strong>{{custom-filter-question[Adding custom filters question] Can I add custom filters or block elements?}}</strong>
    * {{custom-filter-answer[Adding custom filters answer] We are looking into offering this and hope to add it in a future release.}}
