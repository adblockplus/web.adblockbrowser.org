      {{many-permissions-question[Many permissions questions] Why does Adblock Browser for Android require so many permissions?}}
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    {{many-permissions-answer[Many permissions answer] Generally, browsers require more permissions than regular apps to be able to provide web applications the ability to use hardware functionality such as camera, microphone, etc. (e.g. uploading images from your camera). Since Adblock Browser is based on Firefox, it asks for the exact same permissions to do the same things Firefox does. For an explanation of all the permissions, please refer to [this FAQ](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-firefox-android-use-permissions-it-requests) from Mozilla.}}

    {{flash-answer[Flash video support answer] Flash videos do work on Adblock Browser, but you must install the legacy flash player first. However, installing Flash for Android is not recommended as it’s insecure and may contribute to memory loss and slowness. If you still want to do this, refer to [this article](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-watch-flash-videos-firefox-android) from Mozilla.}}

    {{add-ons-answer[Add-ons installation answer] Having started as a browser add-on ourselves, we feel strongly about wanting to support add-ons, and hope to support this in the future. For now, if having add-ons is a deal breaker, we recommend using Firefox for Android with [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/).}}
